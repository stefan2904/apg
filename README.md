APG (Android Privacy Guard)
===========================

OpenPGP for Android.

I'd like to pick this up again, despite the awesome advances of the fork [OpenPGP-Keychain](https://github.com/openpgp-keychain/openpgp-keychain/). Those guys did a great job, but I differ in some of the implementation details and decisions, so I hope the projects can continue to benefit from each other.

APG definitely has some catching up to do. :)
